\section{3SPN.2C}
\label{sec:dna_3spn2c}

The series of the 3SPN.x DNA models have been developed by de Pablo's group.
The 3SPN.2C model is the one for modeling sequence-dependent curvature of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).  Particularly, the model has been well-tuned to
reproduce both mechanical and geometrical properties, such as persistent length
and major/minor groove widths.

\subsection{Topology}
\label{subsec:dna_3spn2c_top}

In this model, each nucleotide is represented by three CG particles, P
(phosphate), S (sugar), and B (base), as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:dna_3spn2c_top}.  B has four types: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G
(guanine), and T (thymine).  The CG particles are put at the center-of-mass of
each chemical moiety.
