\section{3SPN.2C}
\label{sec:dna_3spn2c}

The series of the 3SPN.x DNA models have been developed by de Pablo's group.
The 3SPN.2C model is the one for modeling sequence-dependent curvature of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).  Particularly, the model has been well-tuned to
reproduce both mechanical and geometrical properties, such as persistent length
and major/minor groove widths.

\subsection{Topology}
\label{subsec:dna_3spn2c_top}

In this model, each nucleotide is represented by three CG particles, P
(phosphate), S (sugar), and B (base), as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:dna_3spn2c_top}.  B has four types: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G
(guanine), and T (thymine).  The CG particles are put at the center-of-mass of
each chemical moiety.

\subsection{Potentials}
\label{subsec:dna_3spn2c_potential}

The 3SPN.2C potentials can be devided into two parts, as usual, bonded, and
nonbonded:
\begin{displaymath}
  U = U_b + U_{nb}
\end{displaymath}

The bonded potentials include the following terms:
\begin{itemize}
\item bonds ($U_{bond}$),
\item angles ($U_{ang}$),
\item dihedral angles ($U_{dih}$).
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dna_3spn2c_local}
  U_b = U_{bond} + U_{ang} + U_{dih}
\end{equation}

The nonbonded potentials include these terms:
\begin{itemize}
\item base-base interactions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item base stacking ($U_{bstk}$),
  \item base pairing ($U_{bp}$),
  \item cross base stacking ($U_{cstk}$),
  \end{itemize}
\item excluded volume interactions ($U_{exv}$),
\item electrostatic interactions ($U_{ele}$).
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dna_3spn2c_nonlocal}
  U_{nb} = U_{bp} + U_{bstk} + U_{cstk} + U_{exv} + U_{ele}
\end{equation}
